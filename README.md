# MAZE_ALGORITHM
Maze algorithm that load and solves mazes using stack  

This project loads a txt file containing a 100 by 30 text block and print it as a maze. txt file included(example_maze1.txt and example_maze.txt) are example mazes you can load into the program.(other maze can be loaded in as well). it will then attempt to solve it using a stack. example of the maze sloving process showed below:
